But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?\r\nMonique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.\r\nSummoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love.

I'd been fantasising non-stop about the two of us becoming close. I had visions of us baking together while Richard was at work, chatting about her boyfriends, her studies, what kind of job she'd like to do. I would be someone she could rely on, someone she could talk to when she would have spoken to her mum if she'd still been alive.\r\nAnyway, let's just say things haven't quite worked out that way.\r\nWhenever we're alone, Chloe makes it clear that she hates me. But in front of her father, she's a perfect little angel. Richard says I'm not giving her a chance, but he doesn't see what I see.

Oh, and took over Twitter.\r\nWhen Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.\r\nHis father's impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.\r\nAt the beginning of 2022-after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth-Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. \"I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,\" he said.\r\nIt was a wistful comment, not a New Year's resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world's ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.\r\nFor two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress?",

Further, when they were shown to be demonstrably failing and harming many thousands of people, experienced healthcare professionals who raised informed concerns were silenced through demotion, firing, and organized campaigns of harassment promoted by the news media and enabled by companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok, in some cases in collaboration with the White House and the Department of Justice's FBI.\r\nIf this sounds very bad, it's because it is.\r\nWhat the Nurses Saw is documentation of what happens in the real world when bureaucrats, in this case bureaucrats in Washington DC, take literal dictatorial control over the practice of medicine.\r\nOn a pure dollar and cents level, one of every five dollars spent in the U.S. is spent on the products of the medical services industry, as is one of every three tax dollars. The U.S., more than any country in the world, and by a large measure, has been colonized by this industry. As part of this process, the industry and its operatives have corrupted and perverted science, academia, and the news media. Now it's hard at work to weaken and degrade the last pillar that keeps the system even remotely functioning - the integrity of the nursing profession.\r\nIf we fail to support our good nurses, help them hold the line, and start aggressively turning things around, there is no practical limit to how far this totalitarian medical dictatorship which we in fact live under will go in its future abuse and exploitation of human beings.",

Dopamine ensured the survival of early man. Thousands of years later, it is the source of our most basic behaviors and cultural ideas--and progress itself.\r\nDopamine is the chemical of desire that always asks for more--more stuff, more stimulation, and more surprises. In pursuit of these things, it is undeterred by emotion, fear, or morality. Dopamine is the source of our every urge, that little bit of biology that makes an ambitious business professional sacrifice everything in pursuit of success, or that drives a satisfied spouse to risk it all for the thrill of someone new. Simply put, it is why we seek and succeed; it is why we discover and prosper. Yet, at the same time, it's why we gamble and squander.\r\nFrom dopamine's point of view, it's not the having that matters. It's getting something--anything--that's new. From this understanding--the difference between possessing something versus anticipating it--we can understand in a revolutionary new way why we behave as  we do in love, business, addiction, politics, religion - and we can even predict those behaviors in ourselves and others.\r\nIn The Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity--and will Determine the Fate of the Human Race, George Washington University professor and psychiatrist Daniel Z. Lieberman, MD, and Georgetown University lecturer Michael E. Long present a potentially life-changing proposal: Much of human life has an unconsidered component that explains an array of behaviors previously thought to be unrelated, including why winners cheat, why geniuses often suffer with mental illness, why nearly all diets fail, and why the brains of liberals and conservatives really are different.",

When is the last time you used a fax machine to send a letter? These questions seem absurd. But think about this one: why are you using a 19th-century concept to organize your business? In 1854, a civil engineer created the first organizational chart (org chart) to define the hierarchy and reporting structure of the New York and Erie Railroad. Shockingly, after over 150 years, this antiquated concept still dominates corporate America. The inherent problem is that organizational charts serve next to no functional purpose on a day-to-day basis. It merely defines a rigid reporting structure that is out of touch with the 21st-century workplace.\r\nToday's entrepreneurs need a tool that provides the perspective to view the organization as a unique living organism. Jeffrey DeMure, AIA has designed a new model for organizing your team that serves as an assessment tool to unearth imbalance within your organization and a roadmap for achieving that much-sought-after balance.",

And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.\r\nHeads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all?

She's come a long way from the small town where she grew up-she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life seems too good to be true.\r\nRyle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn't hurt. Lily can't get him out of her head. But Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his \"no dating\" rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.\r\nAs questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan-her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.\r\nAn honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is \"a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper.

No more fourteen-hour work days and rats the size of small toddlers.

Sounds simple, right? Armed with nothing more than her wits and snarky attitude, Mack is about to find out that the charming coastal town has a secret dark side. And the aggravating private investigator with the sexy smile she keeps running into has something to hide, but what?\r\nAs she gets closer to finding the killer, Mack realizes she's next on the hit list. Will she get to the bottom of this case before she finds herself at the bottom of the sea?",

But there are no obvious clues why this levelheaded sixteen-year-old, passionate about her music, would be targeted.\r\nAnd that worries Dallas.

Sometimes, if you are the sad individual who hit a poor shot, you might be tempted to provide an excuse to your playing partners. A good excuse can relieve the tension, and maybe even bring a few laughs.\r\nSometimes, though, an excuse can be hilarious just by its lack of credulity. A golfer can chalk their bad shot up to anything, absolutely anything, and that's when the excuse becomes a funny moment. Golfers share these stories with their friends, and it's not the shot they remember, only the hilarious excuse.\r\nThe Golfer's Excuse Handbook contains 250 excuses on a range of subjects all over the golf course, and a few that extend beyond the links!\r\n\r\nFive different chapters, one for each group of excuses and the topics likely to draw a golfer's ire.\r\nEach chapter features interesting golf history and trivia, as well!\r\nThere are also entertaining golf quotes from players, world leaders, and other well-known individuals within these pages.\r\nChapter subjects include the golf course itself, a golfer's playing partners, and the weather!\r\nThis book will entertain any fan of the game, from those who watch the pros to anyone who dares to swing a club. Perhaps this book can start a conversation with friends and family members about who has the worst excuses on the course, or who has said the most outrageous line in a moment of shame.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a golfer in your life that needs help with their excuse game! This book can also serve any golfer with a ton of ideas on how to deflect the embarrassment of that bad shot. And, if you have someone in your life who is particularly unskilled, they may need multiple excuses to make it through a round!\r\nThis book is bound to bring a smile to anyone who has experienced the struggle of golf. It will make readers smile, laugh out loud, and most importantly, appreciate the joy and pain that is the game of golf.\r\nGrab a copy of The Golfer's Excuse Handbook and tee up the fun today!",
