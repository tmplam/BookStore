From the New York Times bestselling author of Daisy Jones & the Six—an entrancing and “wildly addictive journey of a reclusive Hollywood starlet” (PopSugar) as she reflects on her relentless rise to the top and the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.

Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?

Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.

Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.

“Heartbreaking, yet beautiful” (Jamie Blynn, Us Weekly), The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is “Tinseltown drama at its finest” (Redbook): a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it costs—to face the truth.', '978-1501161933', 9.99, 25, '/images/products/front-cover/ca3337d1-57b9-4d7e-a74c-0303fbc812af.jpg', '/images/products/back-cover/ca3337d1-57b9-4d7e-a74c-0303fbc812af.jpg'),

Well, she was going to find out she had nothing to worry about. I’d been fantasising non-stop about the two of us becoming close. I had visions of us baking together while Richard was at work, chatting about her boyfriends, her studies, what kind of job she’d like to do. I would be someone she could rely on, someone she could talk to when she would have spoken to her mum if she’d still been alive.

Anyway, let’s just say things haven''t quite worked out that way.

Whenever we’re alone, Chloe makes it clear that she hates me. But in front of her father, she’s a perfect little angel. Richard says I’m not giving her a chance, but he doesn’t see what I see. I don’t trust Chloe, and I certainly won’t leave her alone with Evie.

Because I know something isn’t right with Chloe, and I will do everything possible to protect my family.

Oh, and took over Twitter.

When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.

His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.

At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.

Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.

As you will learn from the eye-witness accounts and technical information presented in this book, calling the failed COVID protocols “errors” is not accurate.

What The Nurses Saw — It was Murder.

These protocols were explicitly ordered by those who took dictatorial control of the medical system early in the Panic (spring of 2020). Further, when they were shown to be demonstrably failing and harming many thousands of people, experienced healthcare professionals who raised informed concerns were silenced through demotion, firing, and organized campaigns of harassment promoted by the news media and enabled by companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok, in some cases in collaboration with the White House and the Department of Justice’s FBI.

If this sounds very bad, it’s because it is.

What the Nurses Saw is documentation of what happens in the real world when bureaucrats, in this case bureaucrats in Washington DC, take literal dictatorial control over the practice of medicine.

On a pure dollar and cents level, one of every five dollars spent in the U.S. is spent on the products of the medical services industry, as is one of every three tax dollars. The U.S., more than any country in the world, and by a large measure, has been colonized by this industry. As part of this process, the industry and its operatives have corrupted and perverted science, academia, and the news media. Now it’s hard at work to weaken and degrade the last pillar that keeps the system even remotely functioning — the integrity of the nursing profession.

If we fail to support our good nurses, help them hold the line, and start aggressively turning things around, there is no practical limit to how far this totalitarian medical dictatorship which we in fact live under will go in its future abuse and exploitation of human beings.', '979-8870191508', 13.85, 63, '/images/products/front-cover/01cd923c-98c3-4e4c-9752-fffe1c7d3571.jpg', '/images/products/back-cover/01cd923c-98c3-4e4c-9752-fffe1c7d3571.jpg'),

Why does love change so quickly from passion to indifference? 
Why are some people diehard liberals and others hardcore conservatives? 
Why are we always hopeful for solutions even in the darkest times--and so good at figuring them out? 
The answer is found in a single chemical in your brain: dopamine. Dopamine ensured the survival of early man. Thousands of years later, it is the source of our most basic behaviors and cultural ideas--and progress itself. 
Dopamine is the chemical of desire that always asks for more--more stuff, more stimulation, and more surprises. In pursuit of these things, it is undeterred by emotion, fear, or morality. Dopamine is the source of our every urge, that little bit of biology that makes an ambitious business professional sacrifice everything in pursuit of success, or that drives a satisfied spouse to risk it all for the thrill of someone new. Simply put, it is why we seek and succeed; it is why we discover and prosper. Yet, at the same time, it''s why we gamble and squander. 
From dopamine''s point of view, it''s not the having that matters. It''s getting something--anything--that''s new. From this understanding--the difference between possessing something versus anticipating it--we can understand in a revolutionary new way why we behave as  we do in love, business, addiction, politics, religion - and we can even predict those behaviors in ourselves and others.

Lieberman, MD, and Georgetown University lecturer Michael E.

Can you imagine running your business without the Internet? When is the last time you used a fax machine to send a letter? These questions seem absurd. But think about this one: why are you using a 19th-century concept to organize your business? In 1854, a civil engineer created the first organizational chart (org chart) to define the hierarchy and reporting structure of the New York and Erie Railroad. Shockingly, after over 150 years, this antiquated concept still dominates corporate America. The inherent problem is that organizational charts serve next to no functional purpose on a day-to-day basis. It merely defines a rigid reporting structure that is out of touch with the 21st-century workplace.

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.

Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.

As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband―and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.

Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.

Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.

Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations―a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....', '978-1250301703', 14.35, 46, '/images/products/front-cover/58fda9f9-296c-4784-976e-01bffffb20dc.jpg', '/images/products/back-cover/58fda9f9-296c-4784-976e-01bffffb20dc.jpg'),

A psychological thriller with a twist, Almost Surely Dead is a chilling account of how one woman’s life spins out of control after a terrifying―and seemingly random―attempt on her life.

Dunia Ahmed lives an ordinary life―or she definitely used to. Now she’s the subject of a true crime podcast. She’s been missing for over a year, and no one knows if she’s dead or alive. But her story has listeners obsessed, and people everywhere are sporting merch that demands “Find Dunia!”

In the days before her disappearance, Dunia is a successful pharmacist living in New York. The daughter of Pakistani immigrants, she’s coping with a broken engagement and the death of her mother. But then something happens that really shakes up her world: someone tries to murder her.

When her would-be killer winds up dead, Dunia figures the worst is over. But then there’s another attempt on her life…and another. And police suspect someone close to her may be the culprit. Dunia struggles to make sense of what’s happening. And as childhood superstitions seep into her reality, she becomes convinced that someone―or something―is truly after her.', '978-1662507588', 20.00, 54, '/images/products/front-cover/940da020-03da-4ff0-91fd-455089dbc7d6.jpg', '/images/products/back-cover/940da020-03da-4ff0-91fd-455089dbc7d6.jpg'),

Glucose, or blood sugar, is a tiny molecule in our body that has a huge impact on our health. It enters our bloodstream through the starchy or sweet foods we eat. Ninety percent of us suffer from too much glucose in our system—and most of us don''t know it.

The symptoms? Cravings, fatigue, infertility, hormonal issues, acne, wrinkles… And over time, the development of conditions like type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cancer, dementia, and heart disease.

Drawing on cutting-edge science and her own pioneering research, biochemist Jessie Inchauspé offers ten simple, surprising hacks to help you balance your glucose levels and reverse your symptoms—without going on a diet or giving up the foods you love. For example:
* How eating foods in the right order will make you lose weight effortlessly
* What secret ingredient will allow you to eat dessert and still go into fat-burning mode
* What small change to your breakfast will unlock energy and cut your cravings

Both entertaining, informative, and packed with the latest scientific data, this book presents a new way to think about better health.

Better yet, do you know the frustration and hilarity that comes with trying to play this beautiful sport?

Everyone who has experienced the game of golf understands that it can be frustrating, unfair, and embarrassing to play. Sometimes, if you are the sad individual who hit a poor shot, you might be tempted to provide an excuse to your playing partners. A good excuse can relieve the tension, and maybe even bring a few laughs.

Sometimes, though, an excuse can be hilarious just by its lack of credulity. A golfer can chalk their bad shot up to anything, absolutely anything, and that’s when the excuse becomes a funny moment. Golfers share these stories with their friends, and it’s not the shot they remember, only the hilarious excuse.

The Golfer’s Excuse Handbook contains 250 excuses on a range of subjects all over the golf course, and a few that extend beyond the links!

Five different chapters, one for each group of excuses and the topics likely to draw a golfer’s ire.
Each chapter features interesting golf history and trivia, as well!
There are also entertaining golf quotes from players, world leaders, and other well-known individuals within these pages.
Chapter subjects include the golf course itself, a golfer’s playing partners, and the weather!
This book will entertain any fan of the game, from those who watch the pros to anyone who dares to swing a club. Perhaps this book can start a conversation with friends and family members about who has the worst excuses on the course, or who has said the most outrageous line in a moment of shame.

Maybe there’s a golfer in your life that needs help with their excuse game! This book can also serve any golfer with a ton of ideas on how to deflect the embarrassment of that bad shot. And, if you have someone in your life who is particularly unskilled, they may need multiple excuses to make it through a round!

This book is bound to bring a smile to anyone who has experienced the struggle of golf. It will make readers smile, laugh out loud, and most importantly, appreciate the joy and pain that is the game of golf.
